# PowerPrices
![example workflow](https://github.com/steintokvam/powerprices/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?event=push)

Checks for electricity prices in Norway and serves them on a couple of endpoints. Currently used for [Smartcharging](https://github.com/SteinTokvam/SmartCharger) my easee charger.

## Usage
Available endpoints are 

```
/prices/all
```
Which will give all currently available prices which are the prices for today and if they are available yet also the prices for tomorrow.

```
/prices/cheapest/{from}/{hours}/{to}
```
Which gives a number of cheapest prices specified by hours in the range specified by from and to.
e.g:
```
/prices/cheapest/2023-05-10T10:00/2/2023-05-10T20:00
```
Will return the 2 cheapest hours for May 10, 2023 between 13(1PM) and 20(8PM). The list of prices will be sorted from cheapest to most expensive hour.

Prices are returned as a list of json objects declared like this:
```json
{
  "time_start": LocalDateTime,
  "time_end": LocalDateTime,
  "eur_per_kWh": Float,
  "exr": Float,
  "nok_per_kWh": Float
}
```
